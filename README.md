# WBNM_ENG
Watershed Bounded Network Model Engine
WBNM_ENG is an event based hydrology model capable of simulating runoff from simple to highly complex urbanised catchments.
It includes code to accomodate various means of weighting rain gauges, assigning losses and the simulation of a range of structures on  hydrologic response. Recorded hydrographs can be input and compared to assist calibration. Calibration is largely controlled by one parameter, the lag factor C, typically found to lie in the range 1.3 to 1.7. WBNM was first released in 1994 and has been used widely throught Australia since that time. This present generalised version has been released as Free and Open Source software in the belief that it will be of use to anyone interested in flood hydrology.
